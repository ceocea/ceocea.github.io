What is needed?
- A VPS Server with Node installed. Just install the normal Node Report Bot from askwrite and you should be fine.

How to Setup:

1. Put the web path in your var/www folder.
2. Edit the config file. Fill out the Captcha Data (Google Captcha), MySQL, and Site Password.
3. Now you see 2 points which are called "script_path" and "script_log_path".
4. This is pretty easy. Just upload the server stuff to a folder of your choose. For example i upload it to /var/report-bot
5. So i link to "script_path" = /var/report-bot and "script_log_path" = /var/report-bot/log
6. Run in the Bot Folder npm install to Install the needed modules. 
7. Import the MySQL Database which i passed to the folder web.
8. Add some accounts. It works like in askwrites Report Bot Script. But mine supports Steamguard!
9. To use SteamGuard you need to put in the main folder of the script the sentry file. Like AccountName.sentry
10. To get the OW/Vac-Check working you need to run a cronjob on ow-check.php
11. Have Fun with it. Modify it like you want, but don't remove the Credits please. Thanks!
